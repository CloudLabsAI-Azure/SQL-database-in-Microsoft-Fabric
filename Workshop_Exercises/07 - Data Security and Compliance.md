In this exercise, you have learned how to manage access control in Microsoft Fabric using Workspace roles and SQL native access controls. You have gained practical experience in:
 
- Understanding the four workspace roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer) and their corresponding database permissions.
- Configuring SQL native access controls using the Manage SQL Security UI and Transact-SQL commands.

With this knowledge, you can now effectively manage user permissions and secure SQL databases within Microsoft Fabric. You are ready to move on to the next exercise: Managing Production Workloads.
